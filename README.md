This project is about building an ANN(Artificial Neural Network Network) for Handwritten digits classification.
<br>
I have used Tensorflow and kears to build the ANN to Classify the Handwriten Digits 
Accuracy-97.5
Obervations- The validation loss and accuracy, doesn't improve after a certain period due to overfitting of data.
Learning- Tensorflow, ANN model training, evaluation, <br> we change the architecture of ANN model by 
<list>
<li>Changing the Epochs</li>
<li>Increasimng the hidden layers</li>
<li>Increasing the no of perceptrons</li>
<li>By using another loss and activation functions </li>
</list>
